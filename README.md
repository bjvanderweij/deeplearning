# deeplearning
Place to organise resources around our **Deep Learning track / hackdays** in Amsterdam.


## Practical matters (proposal)

subject: Deep Learning

study group: 1 evening (2-3h) every (other) week

who: need strong CS + LA, pref. some familiarity with machine learning and neural network basics; ideal study groups are 4-6 people (maybe more, it's a hard subject)

where: pref. fixed location; Rockstart, Hackerspace
requires some commitment: can't miss two meetings or homeworks in a row, pref. rotating moderator


## Resources
syllabus, proposal: practical approach, but with deep understanding (not just trying github repos): book Nielsen (ML -> DL), then a course (either Google, creative DL, or (outdated) coursera) with corresponding homeworks. Extra: papers (DL classics, microsoft ebook, IBM watson, DeepMind), practical DL projects (TensorFlow, Theano, Torch, Keras.io), deep dreaming, GPU programming
